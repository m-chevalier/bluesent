Mistral's approach strikes a better balance - you get the benefits of open-source customization without the security risks, and the fine-tuning capabilities are excellent. However, the lack of centralized governance means you're often dealing with compatibility issues between different community implementations. GPT-4's closed-source nature means you're completely dependent on OpenAI, but the performance consistency and reliability are unmatched. The vendor lock-in is real though, and the lack of transparency about training data and model architecture is problematic for our compliance requirements.",
